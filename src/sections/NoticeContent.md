## How is this content rendered?

It is rendered using a tool called Markdown! You can play around with it in an editor like this one:

https://dillinger.io/

This is the easiest way for you to get the formatting you like without having to edit code :)

I would recommend using the website above to write out what you like, and then just paste the changes into this file for it to show up on the website. 

You can even do things like tables pretty easily!

| Table | Column2 |
| ------ | ------ |
| Availability | Test link: [Link to google](www.google.com) |
| Row 2 | Link to: [bing](www.bing.com) |

## How do I edit it?

Just go to [this file](https://github.com/craigloewen-msft/teacher-website/blob/main/src/sections/NoticeContent.md) on the Github repository: https://github.com/craigloewen-msft/teacher-website/blob/main/src/sections/NoticeContent.md

and edit the file. You can see how it's formatted, and use a tool like this website https://dillinger.io/ to make sure you get the formatting right! (It should be pretty easy!)
