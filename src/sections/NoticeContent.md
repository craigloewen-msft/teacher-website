Speak the Real Korean With Friendly Tom!
Hello, everyone!🖐 
My name is Tom, and my Korean name is Hyung seok Lee. 
I am a native Korean living in Seoul. 

Do you want to learn to speak Korean quickly? 
The best way to learn a new language quickly, you need someone to have fun talking to! 
I can be your best Korean tutor and also a best friend. 
Shall we study Korean together? <br/> <br/>

### My Lessons & Teaching Style
😆We Have Fun 👉👉👉 Improvement Comes🤩
Not in textbooks, I will teach you real Korean expressions that are used by real Korean! 
I will correct you with grammar, vocab, pronunciation while we have fun talking about everything. 
I have various hobbies such as singing, listening to music, watching movies, playing sports, cooking, eating and so on. I guess we will have many things in common.
I hope to see you soon!
